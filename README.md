# Turtlebot-Scripts
The Python scripts were written to automate the movement of the turtlebots.
The scripts were initiated with a bash script which controlled whether the robots were in position or not. 
The scripts are esentially the same with the only difference being the positioning of the robot, the conditions to check and the direction of movement.
